# Tutorials

These tutorials walks you through the steps needed to setup and deploy an Offen instance.

Other and more complex configuration options are documented in ["Configuring The Application At Runtime"][config-docs]. General considerations for deploying Offen are described in ["Requirements for Installing Offen"][installation].

If you have questions about configuring and deploying Offen on Ubuntu or any other Linux system that are not covered in this tutorial feel free to [open an issue in our GitHub repository][issues] or send us an email at <hioffen@posteo.de>.
